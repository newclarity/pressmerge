#PressMerge 
_A database merge plugin for WordPress_

This plugin is designed to allow a developer to copy a WordPress website to a local development environment, 
make updates in the content and then merge those updates back into the live/production website.

NOTE: This plugin is **_NOT_** in a form that it can be used without signifcant development.  It is a work-in-progress.  

If you have a business need for this functionality and would be willing to fund further development please contact [NewClarity](mailto:sales@newclarity.net?subject=I+want+to+fund+PressMerge).
